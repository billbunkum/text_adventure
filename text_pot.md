#Quest

You raise your head from the bar-top; the world is swimming. How much have you had to drink? Looking about, you see no one in the bar. Your memory is foggy; you've got to get home...but, alas, there are 3 blocks between you and that sweet heavenly abode! You pull yourself to your feet and nearly vomit. You are, however, no mere mortal who can be disuaded their comfy bed by a little alcohol poisoning. Making your way out into the sick, street light, you hear the dumb sounds of bros chattering and the Orwellian song of police sirens on the whispering wind. Time is short, dear adventurer of the night-stalking wonder! Make haste!

#Cops 

The handful of the boys in blue approach. They are swinging their billy clubs like they mean it. One steps between you and where you're stumbling; he holds up his hand and says, "Good evening, ya doin' alright, son?" Meanwhile, the other cops snicker in the background.

#Bros

A bottle of foul smelling liquor explodes just feet in front of you; green shards of glass scatter every where. Snickering emminates from a tree branch high above you; as you crane your neck in that direction, you see a tall, athletic youth swinging from the branch; a weird symbol is emblazened on his pink sweater. Is it Greek? The bro drops down to the pavement in front of you blocking your path.
"Where do ya think *hic-cup" yer goin', pussy?"
